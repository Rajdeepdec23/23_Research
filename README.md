Research:A relationship between Mental health & Economic Condition in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan 

Submitted to the University of Delhi 

Understanding the relationship between mental health and socioeconomic status is crucial. This abstract emphasizes how socio-economic factors impact mental health outcomes, mental health's role in shaping socio-economic status, and the importance of addressing disparities for overall well-being and social equity. Comprehensive strategies are needed to integrate mental health support and reduce socioeconomic inequalities. Quantitative methods involve collecting and analysing numerical data to study phenomena, relying on statistical analysis for objective conclusions. There is no significant relationship between depression and stress with socio-economic status, but there is a significant relationship with anxiety. The relationship between mental health and socio-economic status has implications for health equity, access to resources, social mobility, and overall quality of life.
